# High-Performance Java Persistence

The [High-Performance Java Persistence](https://vladmihalcea.com/books/high-performance-java-persistence?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=hpjp) book and video course code examples. I wrote [this article](https://vladmihalcea.com/high-performance-java-persistence-github-repository/) about this repository since it's one of the best way to test JDBC, JPA, Hibernate or even jOOQ code. Or, if you prefer videos, you can watch [this presentation on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8MoOe8uMYA).

### Are you struggling with application performance issues?

Imagine having a tool that can automatically detect if you are using JPA and Hibernate properly. No more performance issues, no more having to spend countless hours trying to figure out why your application is barely crawling.

Imagine discovering early during the development cycle that you are using suboptimal mappings and entity relationships or that you are missing performance-related settings. 

More, with Hypersistence Optimizer, you can detect all such issues during testing and make sure you don't deploy to production a change that will affect data access layer performance.

[Hypersistence Optimizer](https://vladmihalcea.com/hypersistence-optimizer/?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=hpjp) is the tool you've been long waiting for!

## Java

All examples require at least Java 13 because of the awesome [Text Blocks](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/355) feature, which makes JPQL and SQL queries so much readable.

## IntelliJ IDEA

On IntelliJ IDEA, the project runs just fine without any special settings.

## Eclipse

If you're using Eclipse, you must use the Open JDK compiler and not the Eclipse-based one which suffers from [this issue](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=434642).

However, on Eclipse it has been reported that you need to consider the following configurations (many thanks to [Urs Joss](https://github.com/ursjoss) for the hints):

1. Eclipse does not automatically treat the generated sources by jpamodelgen as source folders. You need to add a dependency on `hibernate-jpamodelgen` and use the `build-helper-maven-plugin` to source the folders with the generated sources.
2. Secondly, the Maven eclipse plugin e2m seems to have an issue with some plugin configurations. Make sure you configure e2m to ignore the false positives issues (the project runs justs fine from a Maven command line).
3. Thereâ€™s an issue with Eclipse (or probably more specific ecj) to infer the types of parameters in case of method overloading with the methods `doInJpa`, `doInHibernate`, `doInJdbc`. 
Until [this Eclipse issue](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=434642) is fixed, you need to use the Oracle JDK to compile the project.
If you can't change that, you need to rename those overloaded functions as explained by Urs Joss in [this specific commit](https://github.com/ursjoss/high-performance-java-persistence/commit/e975c1bb5c11d9557fcbc3fef88afaf67dc68a25).

## Database setup

The Integration Tests require some external configurations:

- PostgreSQL

    You should install PostgreSQL 11 (or newer) and the password for the `postgres` user should be `admin`.

    Now you need to create a `high_performance_java_persistence` database.
    
- Oracle

    You need to download and install Oracle XE

    Set the `sys` password to `admin`

    Connect to Oracle using the "sys as sysdba" user and create a new user:
    
        alter session set "_ORACLE_SCRIPT"=true;

        create user oracle identified by admin default tablespace users;

        grant dba to oracle;

        alter system set processes=1000 scope=spfile;

        alter system set sessions=1000 scope=spfile;
        
        ALTER PROFILE DEFAULT LIMIT PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME UNLIMITED;

- MySQL

    You should install MySQL 8 (or newer) and the password for the `mysql` user should be `admin`.

    Now, you need to create a `high_performance_java_persistence` schema

    Besides having all privileges on this schema, the `mysql` user also requires select permission on `mysql.PROC`.
    
    If you don't have a `mysql` user created at database installation time, you can create one as follows:
    
    ````
    CREATE USER 'mysql'@'localhost';
    
    SET PASSWORD for 'mysql'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('admin');
    
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON high_performance_java_persistence.* TO 'mysql'@'localhost';
    
    GRANT SELECT ON mysql.* TO 'mysql'@'localhost';
    
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    ````

    Exact instructions can be found in [here](https://github.com/vladmihalcea/high-performance-java-persistence/blob/master/MYSQL.md).

- SQL Server

    You should install SQL Server Express Edition with Tools. Chose mixed mode authentication and set the `sa` user password to `adm1n`.

    Open SQL Server Configuration Manager -> SQL Server Network Configuration and enable Named Pipes and TCP
    
    In the right pane of the TCP/IP option, choose Properties, then IP Addresses and make sure you Enable all listed IP addresses.
    You need to blank the dynamic TCP port value and configure the static TCP port 1433 for all IPs.
        
    Open SQL Server Management Studio and create the `high_performance_java_persistence` database
    
## Maven

To build the project, don't use *install* or *package*. Instead, just compile test classes like this:

    mvn clean test-compile
    
Or you can just run the `build.bat` or `build.sh` scripts which run the above Maven command.
    
Afterward, just pick one test from the IDE and run it individually.

> Don't you run all tests at once (e.g. `mvn clean test`) because the test suite will take a very long time to complete.
>
> So, run the test you are interested in individually.

Enjoy learning more about Java Persistence, Hibernate, and database systems!
